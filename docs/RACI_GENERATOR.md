## Architecture

### Frontend Components

- `RaciHeaderBar` - Logo upload and title editing
- `DescriptionPanel` - AI-powered project description input
- `RolesEditor` / `TasksEditor` - CRUD operations for roles and tasks
- `RaciMatrixEditor` - Interactive matrix with checkboxes
- `RaciCanvasPreview` - Pretty preview with Mermaid diagrams
- `ExportButtons` - Export functionality

### Backend Integration

The frontend calls AI services via Cloudflare Workers:

- **Repository**: `spearyx-backend` (private)
- **Endpoint**: Configured in `src/config/workers.ts`
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation when AI is unavailable

### Data Flow

1. User describes project â†’ Frontend
2. Frontend calls AI Worker â†’ Cloudflare Workers AI
3. AI generates RACI suggestions â†’ Frontend
4. User edits and refines â†’ Frontend state
5. Export generation â†’ Client-side (ExcelJS, React-PDF)

## Technical Details

### Validation Rules

- Exactly one RACI value per (task, role) cell
