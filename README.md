# Spearyx Frontend

A modern React application built with TanStack Start, featuring TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI components.

## Features

- ⚡ **TanStack Start** - Full-stack React framework with SSR and file-based routing
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework with custom design system
- 🧩 **Shadcn UI** - Beautiful and accessible UI components
- 🔧 **TypeScript** - Type-safe development experience
- 🚀 **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- 🎯 **Custom Logo** - SVG logo with targeting reticle and spear design
- 🔄 **Server-Side Rendering** - SSR with route loaders and server functions
- 📊 **RACI Matrix Generator** - Interactive tool for creating project responsibility matrices

## Architecture

This repository contains the **frontend application only**. Backend services and Cloudflare Workers are maintained in a separate private repository:

- 🌍 **Frontend**: `spearyx-frontend` (this repository)
- 🔒 **Backend**: `spearyx-backend` (private repository)

The frontend communicates with backend services via configured API endpoints in `src/config/workers.ts`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Important Notes

- The `src/routeTree.gen.ts` file is committed to the repository as it's required for production builds
- This file is auto-generated by TanStack Router during development

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

4. Click "View SSR Demo" to see server-side rendering in action
